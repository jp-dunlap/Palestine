Palestine is not an abstraction. It is land, water, language, work, and return. This project gathers
primary sources, maps, testimony, and timelines to tell a 4,000-year history with clarity and dignity.
I center Palestinian voices, international law, and anti-colonial method. This is a living archive; errors
will be corrected and sources expanded as comrades contribute.
