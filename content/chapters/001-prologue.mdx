Prologue – On Names, Memory, and Return
Palestine is not an abstraction; it is land, water, language, work, and return. These tangible elements
have   anchored   Palestinian   existence   for   millennia,   long   before   modern   conflict.   This   project   assembles
primary sources, maps, testimony, and timelines to tell a  4,000-year  history of Palestine with clarity and
dignity. It centers Palestinian voices and an anti-colonial method – refusing the imperial habit of renaming
and erasure – and grounds itself in international law as a terrain of struggle (not salvation)
1
2
. In doing
so, we challenge narratives that render Palestine a mere idea or a contested abstraction, instead affirming
it as a real place with an indigenous people and living heritage.
Scope of a 4,000-Year History
Palestine’s   story   stretches   back   to   antiquity.   The   very   name   “Palestine”   has   ancient   roots:   the   Greek
historian  Herodotus,   writing   in   the   5th   century   BCE,   described   a   region   he   called  Palaistinê  between
Phoenicia and Egypt
3
. In fact, “Palestine” (or variants like  Peleset  and  Palastu) appears in Egyptian and
Assyrian records from the Late Bronze Age, and the term was later used by the Romans (Syria Palaestina in
the 2nd century CE) and in early Arabic as Filasṭīn
4
5
. This enduring name signifies a geographic reality
inhabited by diverse peoples over thousands of years. Ancient cities like Jaffa and Gaza exemplify this deep
history. Jaffa (Yaffa), for instance, was originally a Canaanite port and remained continuously inhabited since
the Bronze Age
6
. Gaza, likewise, was a strategic town on the trade routes of Canaan and later a principal
city of the Philistines, anchoring the southern coast of historic Palestine. Through Roman, Byzantine, and
Islamic eras, “Palestine” persisted as a recognized designation for the land
7
. By foregrounding a 4,000-
year timeline, we assert that Palestine is not a modern invention and that its indigenous people’s roots run
deep in the soil.
Covering this vast span, our project navigates from antiquity (Canaanite city-states, Hebrew kingdoms, and
Hellenistic and Arab epochs) to the colonial 20th century and beyond. This long durée approach serves a
political purpose: to challenge erasure and affirm continuous presence. It rebuts the notion – advanced by
some Zionist narratives – that history began when colonial powers or modern Israel appeared. Instead, we
show   how   each   era   left   its   mark   on   Palestine’s   land   and   society,   while   indigenous   continuity   remained
unbroken. In assembling this sweeping history, we draw on the latest scholarship (for example, historian
Nur Masalha’s work linking Bronze Age Palestine to the present
8
9
) and a wealth of archival data. The
scope is ambitious, but essential: only by seeing the full arc can one grasp how today’s struggles are rooted
in centuries of geography and memory.
Methodology: People’s History and Anti-Colonial Approach
Our guiding methodology is anti-colonial and people-centric. Rather than recounting history through the
lens of conquerors or diplomatic elites, we foreground the experiences and voices of ordinary Palestinians.
As oral historian Rosemary Sayigh wrote, “Palestinians: From Peasants to Revolutionaries” is people’s history,
not official history. It is concerned not with great events or leading figures, but with ordinary people’s perceptions
of these events, and how they transformed the lives of those who had no cushion between them and the Disaster
of 1948.”
10
. In that spirit, our narrative elevates peasant villagers, workers, and refugee families – the
1
fellahin and common folk who form the backbone of Palestinian history. Their perspectives have too often
been  omitted  from  textbooks,  yet  “the  voices   of   the   Palestinian  people   themselves  have   been  missing.  The
contemporary Middle Eastern scene is unintelligible without them.”
11
. By centering these voices, we restore
agency to those who endured and resisted colonialism on the ground.
Palestinian testimony and memory  are thus core sources for us. We incorporate oral histories, diaries,
letters, and memoirs that capture how Palestinians themselves understood each era – from life under the
Ottoman  Empire  to  the  traumas  of  the  Nakba  (catastrophe   of   1948)   and   the   ongoing   exile.   In   refugee
camps, memory became a form of resistance: even children born in exile grew up knowing the names of
ancestral   villages   they   had   never   seen
12
.   As   Sayigh   observed   in   the   1970s,  “The   strength   of   village
identification is clear from the way it has persisted in the camps. Quite small children usually know what village
they   come   from…   village   consciousness   persists   in   spite   of   being   overlaid   by   a   Palestinian   national
consciousness.”
12
.   Such   tenacious   remembrance,   passed   down   through   generations,   defied   the
expectations of those who hoped the Palestinian identity would dissipate. (Israel’s first prime minister, David
Ben-Gurion, infamously predicted  “The old will die and the young will forget.”
13
  – but history proved him
wrong,   as   the   young   did  not  forget.)   We   treat   these   collective   memories   and   oral   traditions   not   as
sentimental anecdotes, but as historical data points that, alongside maps and documents, form a  living
archive of Palestinian existence.
In tandem, we engage international law and documentation as tools of historical clarification. Key legal
texts – from the 1917 Balfour Declaration to UN resolutions and the 2004 International Court of Justice (ICJ)
Advisory   Opinion   –   are   used   to   frame   events   and   policies   in   Palestine’s   modern   era.   We   approach
international   law   as  “a   terrain   of   struggle,   not   salvation.”  In   other   words,   legal   rulings   and   UN
pronouncements provide important affirmations of Palestinian rights, but we recognize their limits in the
absence   of   enforcement   or   political   will
14
2
.   For   example,   in   2004   the   ICJ   concluded   that   Israel’s
construction   of   a   separation   wall   in   the   occupied   West   Bank   violates   international   law   and   must   be
dismantled
15
.   The   Court   affirmed   that   the   wall   and   its   associated   regime   impeded   Palestinian   self-
determination and breached numerous humanitarian provisions
16
. This advisory opinion, while a victory
on paper (it “condemned [the Wall] as illegal”
15
), saw little compliance on the ground – illustrating how law
alone   cannot   deliver   freedom.   We   thus   cite   international   law   to   bolster   factual   and   moral   clarity   –   for
instance, documenting that the Fourth Geneva Convention forbids practices like collective punishment – but
we do not imagine that courts or UN resolutions, by themselves, will liberate Palestine. As a footnote in our
text stresses, international law is a tool; movements win on the ground.
2
 The ongoing struggle for justice
necessarily extends beyond the courtroom, into popular resistance, diplomacy, and narrative reclamation.
Finally, our method is anti-colonial in its analysis. We explicitly characterize Zionism and the State of Israel
within   the   framework   of   settler-colonialism   and   apartheid,   rather   than   accepting   euphemisms   about   a
conflict of two equal sides. This stance is grounded in scholarly research and human rights findings, not
merely ideology. Settler-colonial theory, developed by historians like Patrick Wolfe and Lorenzo Veracini,
provides a lens to understand Israel’s formation and policies. As Veracini states plainly: “Zionism is a settler
colonial movement and Israel is a settler colonial state… The Zionists were foreign to Palestine. They aimed to
conquer the land and establish their sovereignty… historically and now, we see in Israel/Palestine a… practice of
replacement   of   Indigenous   Palestinians…   This   is   what   settler   colonialism   looks   like.”
17
.   In   other   settler
societies (from North America to Australia), colonists sought to eliminate or displace the native population;
the Palestinian experience tragically fits this pattern. We incorporate this analytical frame to explain events
like the mass expulsions of 1948 and the continuing land grabs in the occupied territories as part of a
deliberate logic (what Wolfe called “the logic of elimination”) inherent to settler projects
18
17
. Likewise,
2
we use the term apartheid with full awareness of its weight. This term has been adopted by major human
rights organizations to describe Israel’s regime of systemic Jewish supremacy and segregation. In 2021, the
Israeli NGO  B’Tselem  concluded that  “the entire area under Israel’s control between the Jordan River and the
Mediterranean Sea is governed by a single regime, which works to impose Jewish supremacy over Palestinians: an
apartheid regime.”
19
. Human Rights Watch and Amnesty International have since concurred that Israel’s
treatment   of   Palestinians   –   both   citizens   and   those   under   military   rule   –   meets   the   legal   definition   of
apartheid
20
. Our baseline, therefore, names the reality: Israel is a settler-colonial apartheid regime, and
its ongoing dispossession of Palestinians constitutes a series of crimes under international law.
Naming, Erasure, and the Politics of Memory
A key principle of our project is to refuse the imperial habit of renaming and erasure. Colonial powers
throughout history have attempted to rename places and rewrite histories as a means of control – from the
Romans renaming Judea as “Palestina” in 135 CE, to the British and Zionists using biblical toponyms or new
Hebrew names to replace Arabic ones. We consciously counteract this by using indigenous place names and
highlighting their meanings and continuity. The importance of names is not trivial: naming is an assertion
of identity and ownership of history. As an example, we refer to al-Quds (Jerusalem) and al-Khalīl (Hebron)
alongside their anglicized or Hebrew names, to remind readers of the city’s Arab heritage. We speak of
Nablus (an ancient city with roots as Canaanite Shechem) rather than only the Roman renaming “Neapolis.”
In doing so, we align with what Palestinian scholar  Nur Masalha  calls the preservation of  “the memory of
names” as an act of anti-colonial resistance
21
22
.
The Zionist movement in the 20th century engaged in a systematic campaign of geographical renaming as
part of its colonization process. In the wake of the 1948 war, the new State of Israel literally wiped Palestine
off many maps. In July 1949, immediately after the armistice, Prime Minister David Ben-Gurion appointed a
special   committee   of   scholars   tasked   to  erase  all   existing   Arabic   place   names   and  replace  them   with
Hebrew ones
21
. Hundreds of towns, villages, hills, and water sources were given new Hebrew names,
often drawn from the Bible or invented, to cement a narrative of ancient Jewish patrimony and to obscure
the Arab presence. For instance, the village of al-Mujaydil near Nazareth, depopulated in 1948, was renamed
Migdal Ha‘Emeq (“Tower of the Valley”)
23
. The historic town of Beit Jibrin was destroyed and a kibbutz Beit
Guvrin (“House of Men,” echoing the original Semitic meaning) was founded in its place
24
. In the Galilee,
al-Bassa was reborn on the map as Betzet, Lubya became a forested hill near a new Israeli town, and Hittin –
site of Salah al-Din’s victory over the Crusaders – had its name slightly altered to Kfar Hittim, its lands later
turned into an Israeli leisure resort
25
26
. This renaming was not random; it was a deliberate bid to blot
out Palestine’s Arab landscape and recast it as a Jewish-national space. As one Israeli journalist lamented
decades later,  “the Zionist collective memory exists in both our cultural and physical landscape, yet the heavy
price paid by the Palestinians – in lives, in the destruction of hundreds of villages, and in the continuing plight of
the refugees – receives little public recognition.”
27
 In other words, Israeli society commemorated its pioneer
settlements and battles while actively forgetting the Palestinian villages erased to make room for them.
Physical   erasure   accompanied   the   changing   of   names.
 Hundreds   of   Palestinian   villages   were
systematically demolished or depopulated, especially during the Nakba of 1948. Meticulous research by
Palestinian historian Walid Khalidi documented  418 villages  depopulated inside what became Israel, of
which   about   70%   were   completely   razed   to   the   ground
28
.   Often,   the   ruins   were   bulldozed   and   then
afforested or built over to hide any trace of the people who once lived there. A striking testimony comes
from journalist Gideon Levy describing a ruined village west of Jerusalem: “Look at this prickly pear cactus… a
living fence that is now the only monument to the life that once was here. Take a look at the grove of pines around
3
it. Beneath it there was once a village. All of its 405 houses were destroyed in one day in 1948 and its 2,350
inhabitants   scattered.   No   one   ever   told   us   about   this.   The   pines   were   planted   right   afterward   by   the   Jewish
National Fund, to cover the ruins, to cover the possibility of return and maybe also a little of the shame and the
guilt.”
29
30
. Levy’s words illuminate how the act of erasure was twofold – material and narrative. The
Jewish National Fund (JNF)  forests that now dot Israel are not innocent green spaces; many are literally
planted atop the rubble of Palestinian homes, serving to obscure what happened and to prevent refugees
from seeing or re-inhabiting their lands. In some cases, only fragments remain: the crumbling walls of a
mosque with its door welded shut, a lone stone well, rows of sabra cactus (tsabar) marking former field
boundaries – silent witnesses to a vanished people.
31
32
In our telling, we will name these destroyed villages and towns, pinpoint them on maps, and recount their
fate. This is a conscious reversal of Ben-Gurion’s 1949 naming committee. Where the colonizer tried to
delete Palestine’s toponyms, we restore them. The very act of documentation becomes an act of resistance.
As Salman Abu Sitta – who created the Atlas of Palestine – said, his work “saves [the Palestinian names] from
erasure and puts them back on record.”
21
  By preserving the names, we also preserve the human stories
attached to them. Abu Sitta notes that every village name carried local meaning – often a memory of an
ancestor, a landmark, or an event: “Here is where the most beautiful bride was wed; here is where the holy
man was buried; here is the hill from where Napoleon viewed Acre…”
33
. Such micro-histories, encoded in
place names, form the fabric of Palestinian cultural memory. They refute the colonial lie that the land was
barren or that its people have forgotten. Indeed, even after 75+ years of displacement, Palestinian refugees
(and   their   descendants)   famously  keep   the   keys  and   deeds   to   their   old   homes,   and   continue   to
commemorate the villages that no longer exist on official maps. Each year on Yawm al-Nakba (Nakba Day),
new generations march with placards bearing the names of depopulated towns like Lydda, Deir Yasin, Qastal,
Imwas, Suhmata, and hundreds more, ensuring that these names live on in collective consciousness.
Memory, therefore, is a political act. We underline how Palestinians have refused to let their history be
erased. As scholar Karma Nabulsi wrote, the Nakba of 1948  “remains at the heart of [Palestinian] national
identity.” Every family’s lore includes the stories of those final moments in Palestine – the terror and flight from
beloved cities like Jaffa in 1948
34
. Ben-Gurion’s hope that “the young will forget” did not come to pass: “the
young   have   not   forgotten,”  Nabulsi   stresses
13
.   In   fact,   the   trauma   and   injustice   of   dispossession   have
become a rallying memory that binds each generation to the next. Survivors and their descendants turned
remembrance   into   a   form   of   resistance.   Annual   Nakba   memorials,   oral   history   projects,   and   the
preservation of cultural traditions all serve to assert that “the torch has not been extinguished and is passing
from generation to generation.”
35
. Crucially, this memory is not framed as mere victimhood but as impetus
for   ongoing  resistance.   Nabulsi   notes   that   Nakba   Day   is  “all   about   resistance   to   the   current   Palestinian
situation rather than enshrining past memories of victimhood.”
36
 In other words, remembering is tied to the
resolve to change the present and achieve justice – above all, through the demand of return.
The Right of Return: “Return” as Principle and Practice
The concept of  return  (al-`awda) is central to Palestinian identity and to this project’s ethos – so much so
that we include “return” as one of the concrete elements defining Palestine. From the moment the first
refugees were driven from their homes in 1947–48, the dream and right of return became a unifying cause.
It is not only a political claim but a deeply personal yearning for millions in the diaspora. Our narrative will
continually foreground this: the insistence that refugees (whether in Lebanon, Jordan, Gaza, the West Bank,
or further afield) have an inalienable right to go back to their ancestral lands. This right is anchored in
international law (notably UN General Assembly Resolution 194 of 1948, which asserts refugees’ right to
4
return and restitution), and has been reaffirmed over the decades. But beyond legal texts, it lives in the
hearts and customs of the people – in the safeguarding of old house keys, deeds, and the oral transmission
of what each village was like.
Return is not viewed here as a utopian dream deferred to a distant future; it is part of the active political
struggle. Palestinians have organized around “Right of Return” committees, and the principle remains a red
line in all negotiations. Every map we produce in this project, marking depopulated village sites, is implicitly
a   map   of   potential   return   –   a   reminder   that   these   locales   are   not   forgotten   and   that   justice   requires
restoration. We treat return as both a human right and a state of mind: the steadfast refusal to accept that
dispossession   is   permanent.   This   also   reflects   in   how   we   document   ongoing   displacement.   Whether
covering   the   expulsions   from   the   Jerusalem   neighborhood   of   Sheikh   Jarrah   in   the   2020s   or   the   earlier
expulsion of Bedouin communities in the Jordan Valley, we connect these to the continuum of the Nakba – a
“continuing Nakba” where Palestinians are repeatedly uprooted yet continuously claim their right to return
and remain
37
38
.
Notably, even some Israeli and Jewish voices have acknowledged the justice of return, despite its political
sensitivity. We cite these when useful to show a broad moral recognition. For instance, Jewish historian Ilan
Pappé has described Israel’s 1948 actions unequivocally as  “The Ethnic Cleansing of Palestine”  and argues
that reconciliation requires reversing that cleansing. Such perspectives bolster the case that right of return
is not a fanciful extremism, but a logical remedy to an acknowledged crime.
In sum,  “return”  in our prologue is not only about refugees going back physically; it is about  returning
Palestine to itself. It encompasses the return of stolen land, the revival of Palestinian place names, the return
of truth in historical narrative, and ultimately the return of justice. It ties together the threads of names and
memory: Palestinians will not let the world forget what each village was called, who lived there, and what
was lost – and they insist that what was lost can yet be regained.
Ongoing Struggle and the Role of Law
Our   baseline   assertion   –   that   Israel   today   constitutes   a  settler-colonial   apartheid   regime  –   carries   heavy
implications   about   the   present   and   future.   Having   named   the   system,   we   also   document   its  ongoing
crimes:  not  only  the  foundational  dispossession   of   1948,  but  continuous   practices   that   amount   to  war
crimes or crimes against humanity. These include systematic land expropriation, settlement building, home
demolitions,   excessive   use   of   force,   siege   and   collective   punishment,   and   discriminatory   laws.   We   will
provide evidence for each. For example, under military occupation since 1967, Palestinians in the West Bank
and Gaza have endured measures such as curfews, checkpoints, and punitive house demolitions that target
families of suspected militants. In Gaza, the entire civilian population has been subjected to a blockade for
over 15 years. The International Committee of the Red Cross has explicitly stated that Israel’s closure of
Gaza  “constitutes a collective punishment imposed in clear violation of Israel’s obligations under international
humanitarian law.”
39
. By citing such assessments
40
, we place current events (like the strangling siege of
Gaza or the frequent military raids on refugee camps) in the context of legal and moral transgressions, not
“security measures” as often officially claimed. We also highlight the crime of  population transfer  – the
encouragement of Israeli settlers into occupied territory while Palestinians are removed – which violates the
Fourth Geneva Convention. All these ongoing offenses underscore that the Nakba was not a one-time event
but an unfolding process. As Nabulsi writes,  “the relentless and dynamic nature of the catastrophe – it is an
ongoing daily Palestinian experience – binds this generation directly to the older one… The Nakba continues.”
37
.
5
At the same time, we document how Palestinians have fought back on the legal front. They have engaged
international   forums,   from   the   United   Nations   to   the   International   Criminal   Court   (ICC).   Law   is   a
battleground  where   imperial   narratives   are   challenged.   A   notable   example   is   the  2004   ICJ   Advisory
Opinion on the Wall, which we referenced above. Another recent example is Palestine’s submission to the
ICC regarding alleged war crimes in the occupied territories. While such efforts face political obstacles, they
have yielded some recognition – e.g., the ICC opened an investigation in 2021 into the situation in Palestine.
We incorporate these developments to illustrate the concept of “law as struggle”: every lawsuit, UN vote, or
human rights report becomes part of the broader resistance by affirming Palestinian rights and holding the
occupying power accountable (at least in theory). Yet, our narrative remains sober about the limits. Decades
of UN resolutions have not stayed the hand of an aggressive settler movement or an occupation sustained
by military might and superpower backing. The United States and other powers have shielded Israel from
consequences, exemplified by the U.S. vetoing Security Council resolutions and funding Israel’s military to
the tune of billions annually. This imbalance is part of the story we tell – showing that injustice prevails not
from lack of international law but from lack of enforcement.
Thus, we adopt a clear-eyed view:  legal judgments and historical truth-telling are tools to empower
activism and moral clarity, but real change will come from sustained popular struggle and international
solidarity. We take inspiration from anti-colonial movements worldwide which combined documentation of
crimes with grassroots resistance. In South Africa, detailed documentation of apartheid’s horrors helped
galvanize   global   boycotts   and   internal   revolt   that   eventually   ended   the   regime   –   a   parallel   not   lost   on
Palestinians and their supporters, who similarly call for  BDS (Boycott, Divestment, Sanctions)  against Israel
today. Our prologue sets this tone by declaring that we “treat law as a terrain of struggle, not salvation”
14
.
The liberation of Palestine will not be handed down by a court or diplomat; it must be won by the people –
but having history and law on one’s side is a powerful weapon in that fight.
Conclusion: A Living Archive of Dignity
This   project   is   conceived   as   a  living   archive  –   an   ever-growing   repository   of   Palestinian   history   and
heritage,   open   to   additions   and   corrections   as   new   research   or   testimonies   emerge.   In   the   spirit   of
collective work, we invite contributions from comrades in the struggle, whether they be scholars unearthing
new   archival   finds,   descendants   sharing   family   histories,   or   activists   mapping   ongoing   violations.   We
acknowledge   that   errors   may   occur,   and   interpretations   will   evolve;   we   commit   to   rectifying   mistakes
transparently   and   expanding   sources   continually.   This   openness   is   itself   an   anti-colonial   practice,
countering   the   colonial   narrative   which   often   ossifies   false   claims   into   orthodoxy.   Instead,   our   history-
telling is dynamic and self-correcting, drawing strength from community engagement and interdisciplinary
scholarship.
Above all, we strive to narrate Palestine’s 4,000-year journey with  clarity and dignity. Clarity, by cutting
through   propaganda   to   present   well-substantiated   facts   (hence   our   extensive   citations   and   reliance   on
primary sources). And dignity, by respecting the subject of our history – the Palestinian people – not as
perpetual victims, but as agents who have persisted, resisted, and contributed richly to human civilization
and political thought. We refuse to sanitize the brutality they faced (ethnic cleansing, apartheid, massacres)
– naming crimes for what they are – yet we equally refuse to portray Palestinians as erased or defeated.
Every era of oppression was met with resilience: from peasant revolts against Ottoman and British taxes, to
the general strikes and uprisings against British and Zionist colonization, to the steadfastness (sumud) of
refugees and the Intifadas that shook the occupation. In telling this history, we celebrate cultural endurance
–   the   fact   that   Palestinian   families   kept   their   traditions   alive   in   exile,   that   writers,   poets,   and   artists
6
(Mahmoud Darwish, Ghassan Kanafani, Fadwa Tuqan, and countless others) created works that voiced their
people’s aspirations to the world, and that a sense of hope in eventual return was never extinguished.
In sum, “On Names, Memory, and Return” establishes the foundation for understanding Palestine’s past and
present on Palestinian terms. It lays out the scope (vast yet specific), the method (anti-colonial, evidence-
based, people-centered), and the political stance (unapologetically pro-justice). It also sets the stage for the
detailed chapters to follow, which will delve into successive eras and events. By anchoring our prologue in
the   keywords   “names,   memory,   return,”   we   signal   that   this   is   not   a   neutral,   abstract   chronicle,   but   a
purposeful   reclamation   of   history.   As   the   international   jurist  Richard   Falk  once   noted,   the   battle   for
Palestine is also a battle of narratives – to validate the Palestinian narrative is itself an act of liberation. In that
spirit, this living archive seeks to equip readers with knowledge that has been marginalized and to do so in
a way that upholds the dignity of the Palestinian people’s 4,000-year journey. 
Our baseline remains: Israel’s regime of settler-colonial apartheid will be identified as such, and its practices
(from past Nakba to present oppression) will be documented as ongoing crimes – ethnic cleansing, land
theft,  collective   punishment,  apartheid  –   as   defined   by   international   law   and   testified   by   those   who
endure them
41
39
. But equally, we document the unbroken chain of memory and resistance – from the
Canaanite peasants who tilled the soil, to the families expelled in 1948 who kept alive the keys and customs
of their villages, to the young activists today who chant that “the Nakba continues, but so does the struggle.”
This dual narrative of suffering and resistance, loss and hope, is the essence of the story of Palestine. 
This prologue is thus both an introduction and an invitation: an introduction to a people’s epic story, and an
invitation to the reader to engage with that story not as distant history, but as a living, urgent quest for
justice. We begin by honoring the  names  – of places and people – that imperialism tried to erase. We
anchor ourselves in memory, because, for Palestinians, remembering is an act of defiance against erasure.
And we hold fast to the principle of return, because it encapsulates the irrepressible desire for restoration
and freedom. Palestine will not be an abstraction in these pages, but a land and people we come to
know intimately – and whose past and future are inextricably linked.
