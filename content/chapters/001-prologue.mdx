**Palestine is not an abstraction; it is land, water, language, work, and return.**

These tangible elements have anchored Palestinian existence for millennia, long before modern conflict. This project assembles primary sources, maps, testimony, and timelines to tell a

**4,000-year**

history of Palestine with clarity and dignity. It centers Palestinian voices and an anti-colonial method – refusing the imperial habit of renaming and erasure – and grounds itself in international law as a terrain of struggle (not salvation). In doing so, we challenge narratives that render Palestine a mere idea or a contested abstraction, instead affirming it as a real place with an indigenous people and living heritage.

## Scope of a 4,000-Year History

Palestine’s story stretches back to antiquity. The very name “Palestine” has ancient roots: the Greek historian **Herodotus**, writing in the 5th century BCE, described a region he called Palaistinê between Phoenicia and Egypt. In fact, “Palestine” (or variants like *Peleset* and *Palastu*) appears in Egyptian and Assyrian records from the Late Bronze Age, and the term was later used by the Romans (*Syria Palaestina* in the 2nd century CE) and in early Arabic as *Filasṭīn*. This enduring name signifies a geographic reality inhabited by diverse peoples over thousands of years. Ancient cities like **Jaffa** and **Gaza** exemplify this deep history. Jaffa (Yaffa), for instance, was originally a Canaanite port and remained continuously inhabited since the Bronze Age. Gaza, likewise, was a strategic town on the trade routes of Canaan and later a principal city of the Philistines, anchoring the southern coast of historic Palestine. Through Roman, Byzantine, and Islamic eras, “Palestine” persisted as a recognized designation for the land. By foregrounding a 4,000-year timeline, we assert that Palestine is not a modern invention and that its indigenous people’s roots run deep in the soil.

Covering this vast span, our project navigates from antiquity (Canaanite city-states, Hebrew kingdoms, and Hellenistic and Arab epochs) to the colonial 20th century and beyond. This **long durée** approach serves a political purpose: to challenge erasure and affirm continuous presence. It rebuts the notion – advanced by some Zionist narratives – that history began when colonial powers or modern Israel appeared. Instead, we show how each era left its mark on Palestine’s land and society, while indigenous continuity remained unbroken. In assembling this sweeping history, we draw on the latest scholarship (for example, historian Nur Masalha’s work linking Bronze Age Palestine to the present) and a wealth of archival data. The **scope** is ambitious, but essential: only by seeing the full arc can one grasp how today’s struggles are rooted in centuries of geography and memory.

## Methodology: People’s History and Anti-Colonial Approach

Our guiding methodology is **anti-colonial and people-centric**. Rather than recounting history through the lens of conquerors or diplomatic elites, we foreground the experiences and voices of ordinary Palestinians. As oral historian **Rosemary Sayigh** wrote, *“Palestinians: From Peasants to Revolutionaries” is people’s history, not official history. It is concerned not with great events or leading figures, but with ordinary people’s perceptions of these events, and how they transformed the lives of those who had no cushion between them and the Disaster of 1948.”*. In that spirit, our narrative elevates peasant villagers, workers, and refugee families – the **fellahin** and common folk who form the backbone of Palestinian history. Their perspectives have too often been omitted from textbooks, yet *“the voices of the Palestinian people themselves have been missing. The contemporary Middle Eastern scene is unintelligible without them.”*. By centering these voices, we restore agency to those who endured and resisted colonialism on the ground.

**Palestinian testimony and memory** are thus core sources for us. We incorporate oral histories, diaries, letters, and memoirs that capture how Palestinians themselves understood each era – from life under the Ottoman Empire to the traumas of the Nakba (catastrophe of 1948) and the ongoing exile. In refugee camps, memory became a form of resistance: even children born in exile grew up knowing the names of ancestral villages they had never seen. As Sayigh observed in the 1970s, *“The strength of village identification is clear from the way it has persisted in the camps. Quite small children usually know what village they come from… village consciousness persists in spite of being overlaid by a Palestinian national consciousness.”*. Such tenacious remembrance, passed down through generations, defied the expectations of those who hoped the Palestinian identity would dissipate. (Israel’s first prime minister, David Ben-Gurion, infamously predicted *“The old will die and the young will forget.”* – but history proved him wrong, as the young did **not** forget.) We treat these collective memories and oral traditions not as sentimental anecdotes, but as historical data points that, alongside maps and documents, form a **living archive** of Palestinian existence.

In tandem, we engage **international law and documentation** as tools of historical clarification. Key legal texts – from the 1917 Balfour Declaration to UN resolutions and the 2004 International Court of Justice (ICJ) Advisory Opinion – are used to frame events and policies in Palestine’s modern era. We approach international law as *“a terrain of struggle, not salvation.”* In other words, legal rulings and UN pronouncements provide important affirmations of Palestinian rights, but we recognize their limits in the absence of enforcement or political will. For example, in 2004 the ICJ concluded that Israel’s construction of a separation wall in the occupied West Bank violates international law and must be dismantled. The Court affirmed that the wall and its associated regime impeded Palestinian self-determination and breached numerous humanitarian provisions. This advisory opinion, while a victory on paper (it *“condemned [the Wall] as illegal”)*, saw little compliance on the ground – illustrating how law alone cannot deliver freedom. We thus cite international law to bolster factual and moral clarity – for instance, documenting that the Fourth Geneva Convention forbids practices like collective punishment – but we do not imagine that courts or UN resolutions, by themselves, will liberate Palestine. As a footnote in our text stresses, *international law is a tool; movements win on the ground*. The ongoing struggle for justice necessarily extends beyond the courtroom, into popular resistance, diplomacy, and narrative reclamation.

Finally, our method is **anti-colonial** in its analysis. We explicitly characterize Zionism and the State of Israel within the framework of settler-colonialism and apartheid, rather than accepting euphemisms about a conflict of two equal sides. This stance is grounded in scholarly research and human rights findings, not merely ideology. Settler-colonial theory, developed by historians like Patrick Wolfe and Lorenzo Veracini, provides a lens to understand Israel’s formation and policies. As Veracini states plainly: *“Zionism is a settler colonial movement and Israel is a settler colonial state… The Zionists were foreign to Palestine. They aimed to conquer the land and establish their sovereignty… historically and now, we see in Israel/Palestine a… practice of replacement of Indigenous Palestinians… This is what settler colonialism looks like.”*. In other settler societies (from North America to Australia), colonists sought to **eliminate or displace** the native population; the Palestinian experience tragically fits this pattern. We incorporate this analytical frame to explain events like the mass expulsions of 1948 and the continuing land grabs in the occupied territories as part of a deliberate logic (what Wolfe called “the logic of elimination”) inherent to settler projects. Likewise, we use the term **apartheid** with full awareness of its weight. This term has been adopted by major human rights organizations to describe Israel’s regime of systemic Jewish supremacy and segregation. In 2021, the Israeli NGO **B’Tselem** concluded that *“the entire area under Israel’s control between the Jordan River and the Mediterranean Sea is governed by a single regime, which works to impose Jewish supremacy over Palestinians: an apartheid regime.”*. Human Rights Watch and Amnesty International have since concurred that Israel’s treatment of Palestinians – both citizens and those under military rule – meets the legal definition of apartheid. Our baseline, therefore, names the reality: Israel is a settler-colonial apartheid regime, and its ongoing dispossession of Palestinians constitutes a series of crimes under international law.

## Naming, Erasure, and the Politics of Memory

A key principle of our project is to **refuse the imperial habit of renaming and erasure.** Colonial powers throughout history have attempted to rename places and rewrite histories as a means of control – from the Romans renaming Judea as “Palestina” in 135 CE, to the British and Zionists using biblical toponyms or new Hebrew names to replace Arabic ones. We consciously counteract this by using indigenous place names and highlighting their meanings and continuity. The importance of names is not trivial: naming is an assertion of identity and ownership of history. As an example, we refer to *al-Quds* (Jerusalem) and *al-Khalīl* (Hebron) alongside their anglicized or Hebrew names, to remind readers of the city’s Arab heritage. We speak of *Nablus* (an ancient city with roots as Canaanite Shechem) rather than only the Roman renaming “Neapolis.” In doing so, we align with what Palestinian scholar **Nur Masalha** calls the preservation of *“the memory of names”* as an act of anti-colonial resistance.

The Zionist movement in the 20th century engaged in a systematic campaign of geographical renaming as part of its colonization process. In the wake of the 1948 war, the new State of Israel literally wiped Palestine off many maps. In July 1949, immediately after the armistice, Prime Minister **David Ben-Gurion** appointed a special committee of scholars tasked to **erase** all existing Arabic place names and replace them with Hebrew ones. Hundreds of towns, villages, hills, and water sources were given new Hebrew names, often drawn from the Bible or invented, to cement a narrative of ancient Jewish patrimony and to obscure the Arab presence. For instance, the village of *al-Mujaydil* near Nazareth, depopulated in 1948, was renamed **Migdal Ha‘Emeq** (“Tower of the Valley”). The historic town of *Beit Jibrin* was destroyed and a kibbutz **Beit Guvrin** (“House of Men,” echoing the original Semitic meaning) was founded in its place. In the Galilee, *al-Bassa* was reborn on the map as **Betzet**, *Lubya* became a forested hill near a new Israeli town, and *Hittin* – site of Salah al-Din’s victory over the Crusaders – had its name slightly altered to **Kfar Hittim**, its lands later turned into an Israeli leisure resort. This renaming was not random; it was a deliberate bid to blot out Palestine’s Arab landscape and recast it as a Jewish-national space. As one Israeli journalist lamented decades later, *“the Zionist collective memory exists in both our cultural and physical landscape, yet the heavy price paid by the Palestinians – in lives, in the destruction of hundreds of villages, and in the continuing plight of the refugees – receives little public recognition.”* In other words, Israeli society commemorated its pioneer settlements and battles while actively forgetting the Palestinian villages erased to make room for them.

Physical erasure accompanied the changing of names. **Hundreds of Palestinian villages were systematically demolished or depopulated**, especially during the Nakba of 1948. Meticulous research by Palestinian historian Walid Khalidi documented **418 villages** depopulated inside what became Israel, of which about 70% were completely razed to the ground. Often, the ruins were bulldozed and then afforested or built over to hide any trace of the people who once lived there. A striking testimony comes from journalist Gideon Levy describing a ruined village west of Jerusalem: *“Look at this prickly pear cactus… a living fence that is now the only monument to the life that once was here. Take a look at the grove of pines around it. Beneath it there was once a village. All of its 405 houses were destroyed in one day in 1948 and its 2,350 inhabitants scattered. No one ever told us about this. The pines were planted right afterward by the Jewish National Fund, to cover the ruins, to cover the possibility of return and maybe also a little of the shame and the guilt.”*. Levy’s words illuminate how the act of erasure was twofold – material and narrative. The **Jewish National Fund (JNF)** forests that now dot Israel are not innocent green spaces; many are literally planted atop the rubble of Palestinian homes, serving to obscure what happened and to prevent refugees from seeing or re-inhabiting their lands. In some cases, only fragments remain: the crumbling walls of a mosque with its door welded shut, a lone stone well, rows of sabra cactus (tsabar) marking former field boundaries – silent witnesses to a vanished people.

In our telling, we will **name** these destroyed villages and towns, pinpoint them on maps, and recount their fate. This is a conscious reversal of Ben-Gurion’s 1949 naming committee. Where the colonizer tried to delete Palestine’s toponyms, we **restore them**. The very act of documentation becomes an act of resistance. As Salman Abu Sitta – who created the *Atlas of Palestine* – said, his work *“saves [the Palestinian names] from erasure and puts them back on record.”* By preserving the names, we also preserve the human stories attached to them. Abu Sitta notes that **every village name** carried local meaning – often a memory of an ancestor, a landmark, or an event: “Here is where the most beautiful bride was wed; here is where the holy man was buried; here is the hill from where Napoleon viewed Acre…”. Such micro-histories, encoded in place names, form the fabric of Palestinian cultural memory. They refute the colonial lie that the land was barren or that its people have forgotten. Indeed, even after 75+ years of displacement, Palestinian refugees (and their descendants) famously **keep the keys** and deeds to their old homes, and continue to commemorate the villages that no longer exist on official maps. Each year on Yawm al-Nakba (Nakba Day), new generations march with placards bearing the names of depopulated towns like *Lydda, Deir Yasin, Qastal, Imwas, Suhmata*, and hundreds more, ensuring that these names live on in collective consciousness.

**Memory**, therefore, is a political act. We underline how Palestinians have refused to let their history be erased. As scholar Karma Nabulsi wrote, the Nakba of 1948 *“remains at the heart of [Palestinian] national identity.”* Every family’s lore includes the *stories of those final moments in Palestine* – the terror and flight from beloved cities like Jaffa in 1948. Ben-Gurion’s hope that *“the young will forget”* did not come to pass: *“the young have not forgotten,”* Nabulsi stresses. In fact, the trauma and injustice of dispossession have become a rallying memory that binds each generation to the next. Survivors and their descendants turned remembrance into a form of resistance. Annual Nakba memorials, oral history projects, and the preservation of cultural traditions all serve to assert that *“the torch has not been extinguished and is passing from generation to generation.”*. Crucially, this memory is not framed as mere victimhood but as impetus for ongoing **resistance**. Nabulsi notes that Nakba Day is *“all about resistance to the current Palestinian situation rather than enshrining past memories of victimhood.”* In other words, remembering is tied to the resolve to change the present and achieve justice – above all, through the demand of **return**.

## The Rights of Return: "Return" as Principles and Practice

The concept of **return** (al-`awda) is central to Palestinian identity and to this project’s ethos – so much so that we include “return” as one of the concrete elements defining Palestine. From the moment the first refugees were driven from their homes in 1947–48, the dream and right of return became a unifying cause. It is not only a political claim but a deeply personal yearning for millions in the diaspora. Our narrative will continually foreground this: the insistence that refugees (whether in Lebanon, Jordan, Gaza, the West Bank, or further afield) have an inalienable right to go back to their ancestral lands. This right is anchored in international law (notably **UN General Assembly Resolution 194** of 1948, which asserts refugees’ right to return and restitution), and has been reaffirmed over the decades. But beyond legal texts, it lives in the hearts and customs of the people – in the safeguarding of old house keys, deeds, and the oral transmission of what each village was like.

Return is not viewed here as a utopian dream deferred to a distant future; it is part of the active political struggle. Palestinians have organized around *“Right of Return”* committees, and the principle remains a red line in all negotiations. Every map we produce in this project, marking depopulated village sites, is implicitly a map of potential return – a reminder that these locales are not forgotten and that justice requires restoration. We treat **return** as both a human right and a state of mind: the steadfast refusal to accept that dispossession is permanent. This also reflects in how we document ongoing displacement. Whether covering the expulsions from the Jerusalem neighborhood of Sheikh Jarrah in the 2020s or the earlier expulsion of Bedouin communities in the Jordan Valley, we connect these to the continuum of the Nakba – a *“continuing Nakba”* where Palestinians are repeatedly uprooted yet continuously claim their right to return and remain.

Notably, even some Israeli and Jewish voices have acknowledged the justice of return, despite its political sensitivity. We cite these when useful to show a broad moral recognition. For instance, Jewish historian Ilan Pappé has described Israel’s 1948 actions unequivocally as *“The Ethnic Cleansing of Palestine”* and argues that reconciliation requires reversing that cleansing. Such perspectives bolster the case that right of return is not a fanciful extremism, but a logical remedy to an acknowledged crime.

In sum, **“return”** in our prologue is not only about refugees going back physically; it is about returning Palestine to itself. It encompasses the return of stolen land, the revival of Palestinian place names, the return of truth in historical narrative, and ultimately the return of justice. It ties together the threads of names and memory: Palestinians will not let the world forget what each village was called, who lived there, and what was lost – and they insist that what was lost can yet be regained.

## Ongoing Struggle and the Role of Law

Our baseline assertion – that Israel today constitutes a *settler-colonial apartheid regime* – carries heavy implications about the present and future. Having named the system, we also document its **ongoing crimes**: not only the foundational dispossession of 1948, but continuous practices that amount to war crimes or crimes against humanity. These include systematic land expropriation, settlement building, home demolitions, excessive use of force, siege and collective punishment, and discriminatory laws. We will provide evidence for each. For example, under military occupation since 1967, Palestinians in the West Bank and Gaza have endured measures such as curfews, checkpoints, and punitive house demolitions that target families of suspected militants. In Gaza, the entire civilian population has been subjected to a blockade for over 15 years. The International Committee of the Red Cross has explicitly stated that Israel’s closure of Gaza *“constitutes a collective punishment imposed in clear violation of Israel’s obligations under international humanitarian law.”*. By citing such assessments, we place current events (like the strangling siege of Gaza or the frequent military raids on refugee camps) in the context of legal and moral transgressions, not “security measures” as often officially claimed. We also highlight the crime of **population transfer** – the encouragement of Israeli settlers into occupied territory while Palestinians are removed – which violates the Fourth Geneva Convention. All these ongoing offenses underscore that the Nakba was not a one-time event but an unfolding process. As Nabulsi writes, *“the relentless and dynamic nature of the catastrophe – it is an ongoing daily Palestinian experience – binds this generation directly to the older one… The Nakba continues."*.

At the same time, we document how Palestinians have fought back on the legal front. They have engaged international forums, from the United Nations to the International Criminal Court (ICC). Law is a **battleground** where imperial narratives are challenged. A notable example is the **2004 ICJ Advisory Opinion** on the Wall, which we referenced above. Another recent example is Palestine’s submission to the ICC regarding alleged war crimes in the occupied territories. While such efforts face political obstacles, they have yielded some recognition – e.g., the ICC opened an investigation in 2021 into the situation in Palestine. We incorporate these developments to illustrate the concept of “law as struggle”: every lawsuit, UN vote, or human rights report becomes part of the broader resistance by affirming Palestinian rights and holding the occupying power accountable (at least in theory). Yet, our narrative remains sober about the limits. Decades of UN resolutions have not stayed the hand of an aggressive settler movement or an occupation sustained by military might and superpower backing. The United States and other powers have shielded Israel from consequences, exemplified by the U.S. vetoing Security Council resolutions and funding Israel’s military to the tune of billions annually. This imbalance is part of the story we tell – showing that injustice prevails not from lack of international law but from lack of enforcement.

Thus, we adopt a clear-eyed view: **legal judgments and historical truth-telling are tools to empower activism and moral clarity**, but real change will come from sustained popular struggle and international solidarity. We take inspiration from anti-colonial movements worldwide which combined documentation of crimes with grassroots resistance. In South Africa, detailed documentation of apartheid’s horrors helped galvanize global boycotts and internal revolt that eventually ended the regime – a parallel not lost on Palestinians and their supporters, who similarly call for BDS *(Boycott, Divestment, Sanctions)* against Israel today. Our prologue sets this tone by declaring that we “treat law as a terrain of struggle, not salvation”. The liberation of Palestine will not be handed down by a court or diplomat; it must be **won by the people** – but having history and law on one’s side is a powerful weapon in that fight.

## Conclusion: A Living Archive of Dignity

This project is conceived as a **living archive** – an ever-growing repository of Palestinian history and heritage, open to additions and corrections as new research or testimonies emerge. In the spirit of collective work, we invite contributions from comrades in the struggle, whether they be scholars unearthing new archival finds, descendants sharing family histories, or activists mapping ongoing violations. We acknowledge that errors may occur, and interpretations will evolve; we commit to rectifying mistakes transparently and expanding sources continually. This openness is itself an anti-colonial practice, countering the colonial narrative which often ossifies false claims into orthodoxy. Instead, our history-telling is dynamic and self-correcting, drawing strength from community engagement and interdisciplinary scholarship.

Above all, we strive to narrate Palestine’s 4,000-year journey with **clarity and dignity**. Clarity, by cutting through propaganda to present well-substantiated facts (hence our extensive citations and reliance on primary sources). And dignity, by respecting the subject of our history – the Palestinian people – not as perpetual victims, but as agents who have persisted, resisted, and contributed richly to human civilization and political thought. We refuse to sanitize the brutality they faced (ethnic cleansing, apartheid, massacres) – naming crimes for what they are – yet we equally refuse to portray Palestinians as erased or defeated. Every era of oppression was met with resilience: from peasant revolts against Ottoman and British taxes, to the general strikes and uprisings against British and Zionist colonization, to the steadfastness *(sumud)* of refugees and the Intifadas that shook the occupation. In telling this history, we celebrate cultural endurance – the fact that Palestinian families kept their traditions alive in exile, that writers, poets, and artists (Mahmoud Darwish, Ghassan Kanafani, Fadwa Tuqan, and countless others) created works that voiced their people’s aspirations to the world, and that a sense of hope in eventual return was never extinguished.

In sum, *“On Names, Memory, and Return”* establishes the foundation for understanding Palestine’s past and present on **Palestinian terms**. It lays out the scope (vast yet specific), the method (anti-colonial, evidence-based, people-centered), and the political stance (unapologetically pro-justice). It also sets the stage for the detailed chapters to follow, which will delve into successive eras and events. By anchoring our prologue in the keywords “names, memory, return,” we signal that this is not a neutral, abstract chronicle, but a purposeful reclamation of history. As the international jurist **Richard Falk** once noted, the battle for Palestine is also a battle of narratives – to *validate the Palestinian narrative is itself an act of liberation*. In that spirit, this living archive seeks to equip readers with knowledge that has been marginalized and to do so in a way that upholds the dignity of the Palestinian people’s 4,000-year journey.

Our baseline remains: Israel’s regime of settler-colonial apartheid will be identified as such, and its practices (from past Nakba to present oppression) will be documented as ongoing crimes – **ethnic cleansing, land theft, collective punishment, apartheid** – as defined by international law and testified by those who endure them. But equally, we document the unbroken chain of **memory and resistance** – from the Canaanite peasants who tilled the soil, to the families expelled in 1948 who kept alive the keys and customs of their villages, to the young activists today who chant that *“the Nakba continues, but so does the struggle.”* This dual narrative of suffering and resistance, loss and hope, is the essence of the story of Palestine.

This prologue is thus both an introduction and an invitation: an introduction to a people’s epic story, and an invitation to the reader to engage with that story not as distant history, but as a living, urgent quest for justice. We begin by honoring the **names** – of places and people – that imperialism tried to erase. We anchor ourselves in **memory**, because, for Palestinians, remembering is an act of defiance against erasure. And we hold fast to the principle of **return**, because it encapsulates the irrepressible desire for restoration and freedom. **Palestine will not be an abstraction in these pages, but a land and people we come to know intimately – and whose past and future are inextricably linked.**
