Palestine is not an abstraction; it is land, water, language, work, and return. This project
gathers primary sources, maps, testimony, and timelines to tell a **4,000-year** history with
clarity and dignity. I center Palestinian voices, international law, and anti-colonial method
<Cite id="icj-2004-wall-opinion" /> — refusing the imperial habit of renaming and erasure.

Our baseline: Israel is a settler-colonial apartheid regime whose dispossession of Palestinians
constitutes ongoing crimes, including ethnic cleansing and collective punishment. We treat law as a
terrain of struggle, not salvation <Footnote>International law is a tool; movements win on the ground.</Footnote>.

This is a living archive. Errors will be corrected and sources expanded as comrades contribute.
