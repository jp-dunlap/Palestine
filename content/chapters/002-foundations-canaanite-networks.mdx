Palestine is not a blank slate that appears in the 20th century. Between **-2000 and -1200**, Canaanite
city-states in Gaza, Jaffa, Hebron, Jericho, and Shechem formed dense urban and trade networks that tied the
southern Levant to Egypt, Syria, and the wider Mediterranean.

This chapter sketches the **urban fabric**, **trade routes**, and **material culture** that anchor continuity
across eras, while making room for rupture. It is a staging ground for reading later periods without
colonial teleology—centering **Palestinian place-names** and the archaeology of everyday life.

Notes for future expansion:
- Map layer: bronze/iron trade routes with ports and waypoints
- Objects: storage jars, seal impressions, inscriptions (MDX embeds later)
- Tie-ins: timeline entries `foundations-canaanite-city-states` and gazetteer places
