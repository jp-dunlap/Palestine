Welcome to the first lesson in the Palestine learning series. This module combines archival sources, oral history prompts, and
accessible cartography to support community teach-ins.

## Objectives

- Ground participants in the geography of pre-1948 Palestine.
- Surface local memories through oral history prompts.
- Offer follow-up resources for self-directed study.

## Materials

- Printed excerpts from the **Palestine Gazetteer** (see `/map`).
- Audio clip from *Voices of Return* (provided under Creative Commons).
- Large-format blank map for group annotations.

## Flow

1. **Opening circle (15 min)** — invite participants to share a place name they carry and why it matters.
2. **Mapping exercise (35 min)** — using the blank map, locate cities and villages referenced in the gazetteer.
3. **Oral history pairs (30 min)** — rotate partners and respond to the prompts below.
4. **Collective notes (20 min)** — document themes that emerged, flag follow-up research questions.
5. **Closing (10 min)** — remind participants of the digital archive and how to submit corrections or additions.

## Prompts

- "Tell me about an elder who held onto a key, deed, or document from Palestine. What did they teach you about that object?"
- "Which maps of Palestine have you seen before today? How do they compare to what we worked with here?"

## Follow-up resources

- **Timeline module:** `/timeline`
- **Movement history reader:** `/chapters/001-prologue`
- **Contribution flow:** `/submit`

Remember: do not record participants without consent. Respect boundaries and allow people to pass.
