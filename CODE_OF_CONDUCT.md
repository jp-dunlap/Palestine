# Code of Conduct â€” Palestine

This project advances a rigorous, accessible, anti-colonial public history of Palestine. Participation means aligning with the following:

## Commitments
- **Dignity & Safety:** No harassment, no bigotry. Distinguish *anti-Zionism* from antisemitism; reject racism, Islamophobia, and all forms of hate.
- **Rigor:** Cite sources. Mark speculation vs. established fact. Respect archival provenance and consent.
- **Privacy:** Do not include personal data without explicit permission. No surveillance trackers or closed telemetry.
- **Accessibility:** Provide alt text, transcripts, and semantic structure.

## Scope & Content
- Center Palestinian voices and international law (ICJ/ICC, UN documentation).
- Use clear language. Avoid militarized or dehumanizing metaphors in variable names, commit messages, or UI copy.

## Reporting
Open an issue titled **[conduct]** with minimal necessary detail, or email the maintainer listed in `README.md`. Harassment or hate results in removal from collaboration.

## Attribution & Licensing
- **Code:** MIT (`LICENSE`)
- **Content:** CC BY-SA 4.0 (`LICENSE-CONTENT`)
Contributors agree that submissions are licensed accordingly.

## Enforcement
Maintainers may edit, reject, or revert contributions that violate this Code or project scope.
